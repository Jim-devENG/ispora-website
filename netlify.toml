# NOTE: LEGACY NETLIFY CONFIGURATION
# This file is legacy (Netlify deployment). The current live deployment is intended to be on Vercel.
# If ispora.com is still pointing at Netlify, this could explain differences between local and live behavior.
# The active deployment should use Vercel (vercel.json) with API routes in api/ folder.
# This netlify.toml and netlify/functions/ directory are kept for reference but should NOT be used.
